Frequently Asked Questions

 The following are frequently asked questions and their respective answers.

 Q: Why isn't the plugin in Maven Central?

 A: The plugin was developed to satisfy the needs of the MoTeCH project, and
 isn't 'blessed' by the OpenMRS community at this time. The MoTeCH project
 isn't syncing artifacts to repo1 currently, but it may happen some time in the
 near future.
